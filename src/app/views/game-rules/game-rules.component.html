              One Player must act as the initiator and select the 'Create Playground' open and hit next, this will generate their PlayerId (token).
              This Player must then share his PlayerId (token) with the other Player (the copy icon on the dialog will let you copy the PlayerId (token)) they wish to connect with (Share this token manually via. SMS, chat message etc.)

                  The Player needs to pick <b>3 Lies</b> and <b>1 Truth</b>.

                </li>

                </li>
                <li>
                  Next the evaluation will be done where the Game will determine if the choice made by the player choosing the cards matches with the options picked by the other player.
                  That is, either the <b>Truth</b> option <i>picked</i> by the player matches the <b>Truth</b> option <i>chosen</i> by other player or the <b>Lies</b> options <i>picked</i> by the player matches the <b>Lies</b> option <i>chosen</i> by the other player

                </li>
                <li>
                  Likewise every other rounds will continue with one <b>'Pick'</b> and followed by one <b>'Choose'</b> round.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ol>

          Game Perks -
          <p>
            The Game also provides an option to the players to increase their rate of guessing successfully.
          </p>
          <p>
            To the left side of the screen will be a <b>'Void Zone' ‚ö´</b> containing discarded cards along the different rounds being conducted within the game.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the count of the cards in the <b>'Voided Zone'</b> increases more than 0 and the player hovers over that section, a button labelled <b>'Inspect Cards'</b> will appear.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              By clicking on the <b>'Inspect Cards'</b> button the player can get to see the cards which have been discarded so far throughout the game.
            </li>
            <li>
              This would provide the Player an insight to evaluate which amongst the provided <b>Choices</b> could be invalid.
            </li>
            <li>
              An advice would be to use this option midway into the game as more cards gets discarded and hence the insight from these cards will be more accurate.
            </li>
            <li>
              When this option is chosen to be used, it will show the Player a prompt to confirm usage of the same. This is because the players have only <b>4 Lifelines</b>
            </li>
            <li>
              The <b>'Lifelines'</b> are represented as <i>Hearts ‚ô•</i> on the top left section of the screen. It also indicates the lifelines left by the opponent player. Allowing the player to make useful strategies! üß†üéØ
            </li>
            <li>
              The <b>'Lifelines'</b> are lost each time you choose to <b>Inspect</b> the cards.
            </li>
          </ul>
